Chi.Mei.Wang.Liang(魑魅魍魉)” are all kinds of monsters in ancient Chinese legends. Among them, “Chi.Mei(魑魅)” in the mountains and “Wang.Liang(魍魉)”in the water. Chi.Mei.Wang.Liang are four interesting Chinese characters. In many traditional text descriptions, they are ghosts, evil symbols, but I think these words should be more neutral, not evil and good, just a kind of existence. It's more like all the creatures in the world: people, animals, plants and other species. They were born, developed, and died out the same way. I write these four characters with heavy regular script, look at each calligraphy work carefully, like a face with all kinds of expressions. There is joy, anger, sorrow, and tenderness. I have tried to use computer programming to process calligraphy works, and with some dynamic changes, I hope that calligraphy and computer programming will expand the expression of art of calligraphy, which I think is an expression of certainty and uncertainty. I used a few less complex mathematical formulas, some image processing methods, and particle system simulations. It's not rocket science, but I think it's interesting. The NFT collection, built around the characters "Chi.Mei.Wang.Liang'', will also be cast and released on RMRK' s singular NFT platform. A total of 12 works were produced, including the original written calligraphy works, the birth, growth, change and death of the essence of several themes. They construction a cycle of reincarnation.
